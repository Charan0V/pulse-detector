# pulse-detector

This project is a Flask-based web application that estimates a userâ€™s pulse rate using their webcam by analyzing subtle color changes in their facial skin. When the user clicks the start button, the app captures 25 seconds of video, detects the face and eyes using MTCNN, and extracts the green channel values from a region of interest between the eyes. The raw signal is processed with a bandpass filter to isolate the heart rate frequency, and an FFT is applied to estimate the beats per minute (BPM). The app displays the BPM along with a pulse waveform plot for visual feedback. It features a modern, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS, including a loading spinner during measurement and clear result display. This project showcases integration of computer vision, signal processing, and web technologies for a practical health monitoring tool that runs locally without specialized hardware.
